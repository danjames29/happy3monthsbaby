    <h1>💚 Happy 3 Months, Baba 🤍</h1>

    <p>Baba, I still remember the night I almost walked away completely. I was hurting, confused, and felt like I was losing the one person I truly loved. It broke me because no matter how much pain I felt, I still cared. I tried to act strong, but deep down I just wanted you to come back. And when you did, everything started to make sense again.</p>

    <p>The way we reconnected, the way our bond grew, it made me realize that love isn’t about being perfect, it’s about holding on even when it’s hard. You gave me a reason to believe again, to trust again, and to feel that warmth I thought I lost. Every day with you since then has felt different, softer, and real.</p>

    <p>I know I still overthink, and sometimes fear losing you, yes soon our calls will come to an end for a while until everything gets better. It will be hard for me and communication will drop, I just hope our love for each other won’t, but that’s only because you mean so much to me baby. You became my home, my calm, my peace in this world. I can’t explain how grateful I am for us, for the love we rebuilt, and for every moment we’ve shared.</p>

    <p>And baba, I mean this from my heart, I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Through every up and down, every laugh and every tear, I just want it to be you. Always you.</p>

    <p>Also, I stole this from somewhere I heard it today. Do you know where I got it from? But it just reminded me of you 👀</p>

    <p>When I say you're mine, I don't mean you belong to me, I mean you belong with me. Like the tide belongs to the moon, like the stars belong to the sky, like breath belongs to lungs. When I say I want you, I don't mean to keep you locked away, I mean I want to witness your life unfold.</p>

    <p>I want to watch you bloom the way the sun leans toward flowers, the way a window quietly cradles the seasons, never interfering, just holding space. When I say I'll never let you go, I don't mean I'll grip too tightly, I mean I'll stand beside you the way the shore meets the sea, sometimes calm, sometimes wild, but always returning, always near, because love isn't about possession, it's about presence, it's about choosing each other over and over, even when the world gives a thousand reasons not to. So really, when I say you're mine, what I mean is I'm yours.</p>

    <p class="signature">Happy 3 months baba, ek is lief vir jou, <br>Antonette Grobler 💚</p>
